## Front-end coding assessment
_front-end coding assessment I had to complete for a job interview._

## **THE BRIEF**

As a next step, we'd like you complete this short frontend task for us. This would just be for us to get a rough idea of your technical abilities. Please feel free to do it at your leisure and get back to us whenever you're ready.

Task: Create an attractive and functional snippet to display Desert Whisper on an accommodation booking website or app in the search results page.

The following must be visible on the snippet:

- Property Name
- Price
- Region(s)
- Review score
- Property Image (at least 1)

But you may also include other elements you feel would be helpful to display.
You can find all the information you need here: https://www.lekkeslaap.co.za/accommodation/desert-whisper

Additional information:

- We only need to see this component, you don't need to create a full webpage/app.
- All data/text can be hardcoded (ie. you don‚Äôt need to do API calls or implement a database). You can make up any dummy data if you need to.
- Tripco uses Imgix for rendering and distributing its images. You can simply re-use the source URLs available on our website.
- Feel free to use whatever technology/framework/libraries you feel most comfortable with‚Äîyou can showcase the best of your abilities here!
- We need to see both the source code and a demo (the demo can be something we build/run locally, just provide us with instructions on how to do so).
- Please don‚Äôt just copy the look of the snippets on LekkeSlaap, we want to see your original design and creativity üôÇ
  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

## How I passed this part of the interviewing process?üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Nothing too fancy‚Äîjust rolled with plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. My goal was to showcase that I can whip up good-looking, responsive websites using the basics, proving I know my stuff. And tossed in some JavaScript for functionality to finish it off.
